## Features

### Phase 1: Human-Playable Snake Game
- 20x20 grid with pygame rendering
- Arrow key controls (↑↓←→)
- Constant 10 FPS gameplay
- Perimeter walls only (no internal obstacles)
- Basic scoring: +1 per food eaten
- Game over on wall/self collision

### Phase 2: Random AI Baseline
- Random valid move selection (avoids immediate death)
- Performance statistics collection
- Baseline metrics: **1.61 average score** over 100 games

### Phase 3: Q-Learning Agent
- **Structured state representation**:
  - Head position relative to food (8-directional)
  - Immediate danger detection (left/straight/right)
  - Distance to walls in current direction
- **Reward system**: +10 food, -10 death, -0.1 per step
- **Training results**: **16.48 average score** (923% improvement over random)

## Performance Comparison

| Agent Type | Average Score | Best Score | Games with Score ≥ 10 |
|------------|---------------|------------|----------------------|
| Random Baseline | 1.61 | 5 | 0/100 |
| Q-Learning (1000 episodes) | 16.48 | 39 | 82/100 |

## Installation & Usage

1. **Setup environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Play human game**:
   ```bash
   python3 snake_game.py
   ```

3. **Test random baseline**:
   ```bash
   python3 random_agent.py
   ```

4. **Train Q-learning agent**:
   ```bash
   python3 qlearning_agent.py
   ```

5. **View training dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python3 training_dashboard.py
   ```

## Key Results

The Q-learning agent demonstrates significant learning capability:
- **923% improvement** over random baseline
- **100% game completion rate** (vs 82% for random)
- **Consistent high performance**: 82/100 games scored ≥ 10 points
- **Learning progression**: Clear improvement from 0.08 to 11.80 average score during training

## Technical Implementation

- **State Space**: Structured representation with food direction, danger detection, and wall distance
- **Action Space**: Four directional moves with illegal move prevention
- **Q-Learning**: Tabular approach with ε-greedy exploration
- **Training**: 1000 episodes with epsilon decay (1.0 → 0.01)
- **Visualization**: Real-time training dashboard with score trends and Q-table heatmaps

This project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of Q-learning for game AI, achieving substantial performance improvements over random baseline through structured state representation and reward engineering.
